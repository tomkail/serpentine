# Serpentine

A geometric design tool for creating smooth, organic paths defined by circles.

## What it does

Place circles on an infinite canvas, and Serpentine automatically renders a path that wraps around them.
This allows better rounded curves than traditional bezier curves allow, and makes editing faster.

This approach is particularly valuable for:

- **Luthiers** designing guitar bodies and instrument outlines
- **Industrial designers** creating smooth product contours
- **Typographers** constructing letterforms

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
